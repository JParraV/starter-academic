Currently, I am a PhD student at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy & Biomedical Sciences, where I study the evolution of the specialised metabolism of _Pseudonocardia_ spp. isolated from the Southern Ocean. By applying metabolomics and genomics tools, I am looking to discover novel and interesting bioactive compounds.
