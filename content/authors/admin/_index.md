After obtaining a Pharmacy degree and an MSc in Chemistry at the University of Costa Rica, I pursued a PhD in the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy & Biomedical Sciences, working in the group of [Katherine R. Duncan](http://medicinesfromthesea.com).

Currently, I am an assistant professor of pharmacognosy and medicinal chemistry at the [Faculty of Pharmacy](https://farmacia.ucr.ac.cr/) of the University of Costa Rica. I also work as an associate researcher in the [CENIBiot](http://www.cenibiot.ac.cr/) and [CIPRONA](http://ciprona.ucr.ac.cr/) laboratories, where I explore the chemical ecology of actinomycetes isolated from marine environments. By applying metabolomics and genomics tools, I try to understand the evolutionary and ecological boundaries of the specialised metabolisms of these microorganisms, as well as discover novel and interesting bioactive compounds.
