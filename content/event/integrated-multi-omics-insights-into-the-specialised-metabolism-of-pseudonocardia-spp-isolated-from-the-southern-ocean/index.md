title: Integrated multi-omics insights into the specialised metabolism of
  Pseudonocardia spp. isolated from the Southern Ocean
abstract: >-
  Multidrug-resistant pathogens have become a global threat. Therefore, there is
  an urgent need for finding new therapeutic alternatives. The class
  Actinobacteria have been proven to be an exceptional source of antimicrobial
  compounds. In particular, rare actinomycetes isolated from marine environments
  represent a rich source of yet untapped specialised metabolites.

  A total of 25 Pseudonocardia strains were isolated from sediment collected at the Southern Ocean. Phylogenetic analysis of these strains showed a distribution of them in three clades and suggested them as a potential new species. In this study, these strains were characterised as a possible source of novel antimicrobial compounds by applying genome mining and comparative metabolomics approaches. The whole genome of eight strains was sequenced and the Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGC) analysed. In addition, a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis of one representative strain from the three lineages, alongside nine reference Pseudonocardia, was carried out. The results revealed a high chemical diversity, as well as a correlation to their evolutionary history. Furthermore, co-culture challenge assays and imaging mass spectrometry revealed the role of some metabolites in antagonistic inter-species interactions. In addition, these strains showed activity against the multidrug-resistant fungus Candida auris. With this work three new species were identified, two of them formally described as P. abyssalis sp. nov. and P. oceani sp. nov. The complementary application of genome mining and comparative metabolomics provides insights into the specialised metabolism of rare actinomycetes isolated from an extreme marine environment.
