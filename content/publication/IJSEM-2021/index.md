abstract: The actinomycetes strains KRD168T and KRD185T were isolated from sediments collected from the deep Southern Ocean and, in this work, they are described as representing two novel species of the genus _Pseudonocardia_ through a polyphasic approach. Despite sharing >99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with other members of the genus, comparative genomic analysis allowed species delimitation based on average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization. The KRD168T genome is characterized by a size of 6.31 Mbp and a G+C content of 73.44 mol%, while the KRD185T genome has a size of 6.82 Mbp and a G+C content of 73.98 mol%. Both strains contain meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, glucose as the major whole-cell sugar, MK-8(H4) as a major menaquinone and iso-branched hexadecanoic acid as a major fatty acid. Biochemical and fatty acid analyses also revealed differences between these strains and their phylogenetic neighbours, supporting their status as distinct species. The names _Pseudonocardia abyssalis_ sp. nov. (type strain KRD168T=DSM 111918T=NCIMB 15270T) and _Pseudonocardia oceani_ (type strain KRD185T=DSM 111919T=NCIMB 15269T) are proposed.

summary: Two novel actinomycetes species _Pseudonocardia abyssalis_ sp. nov. and _Pseudonocardia oceani_ sp. nov. were described.
