abstract: "Actinobacteria is an ancient phylum of Gram-positive bacteria with a
  characteristic high GC content to their DNA. The ActinoBase Wiki is focused on
  the filamentous actinobacteria, such as Streptomyces species, and the
  techniques and growth conditions used to study them. These organisms are
  studied because of their complex developmental life cycles and diverse
  specialised metabolism which produces many of the antibiotics currently used
  in the clinic. ActinoBase is a community effort that provides valuable and
  freely accessible resources, including protocols and practical information
  about filamentous actinobacteria. It is aimed at enabling knowledge exchange
  between members of the international research community working with these
  fascinating bacteria. ActinoBase is an anchor platform that underpins
  worldwide efforts to understand the ecology, biology and metabolic potential
  of these organisms. There are two key differences that set ActinoBase apart
  from other Wiki-based platforms: [1] ActinoBase is specifically aimed at
  researchers working on filamentous actinobacteria and is tailored to help
  users overcome challenges working with these bacteria and [2] it provides a
  freely accessible resource with global networking opportunities for
  researchers with a broad range of experience in this field."
